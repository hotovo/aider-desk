Prerequisite: Before using, check the current context with 'get_context_files'. Do NOT add files already present in the context.
Use relative file path(s) for files intended for editing within the project. Use absolute file path(s) for read-only files (e.g., outside the project).`,

Note: Unless explicitly requested by the user to remove specific file(s), this tool should primarily be used to remove files that were previously added using 'add_context_files' (e.g., after a related 'run_prompt' task is completed).`,
  [AIDER_TOOL_RUN_PROMPT]: `Delegates a natural language coding task to the Aider assistant for execution within the current project context.
Use this tool for:
- Writing new code.
- Modifying or refactoring existing code.
- Explaining code segments.
- Debugging code.
- Implementing new features.
- This tools must be preferred (if not specified by user otherwise) over other tools creating or modifying files, as it is more efficient and effective.

Prerequisites
- All relevant existing project files for the task MUST be added to the Aider context using 'add_context_files' BEFORE calling this tool.

Input:
- A clear, complete, and standalone natural language prompt describing the coding task.

Restrictions:
- Prompts MUST be language-agnostic. Do NOT mention specific programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript), libraries, or syntax elements.
- Treat Aider as a capable programmer; provide sufficient detail but avoid excessive handholding.
