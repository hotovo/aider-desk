# UsageDashboard Component Improvement Suggestions

## Current Dashboard Overview

The UsageDashboard component currently provides a tabular view of AI usage data with the following functionality:

- **Data Display**: Shows aggregated usage data by day in a table format
- **Filtering**: Supports date range selection (This Month, Today, Custom), project filtering, and model filtering
- **Metrics Tracked**: Input tokens, output tokens, cache read/write tokens, total tokens, and cost
- **Data Aggregation**: Groups usage data by day and combines multiple projects/models used on the same day
- **Real-time Updates**: Includes refresh functionality and loading states

The current implementation is functional but limited to a single table view, missing visual charts and advanced analytics that would provide better insights into usage patterns.

## Proposed Additional Charts

### 1. Token Usage Trend Chart (Line Chart)
**Description**: A multi-line chart showing token usage over time with separate lines for input, output, and cache tokens.

**Rationale**: 
- Helps users identify usage patterns and trends over time
- Makes it easy to spot spikes or unusual activity
- Provides visual context that's harder to discern from tabular data

**Implementation Details**:
- Use a charting library like Recharts or Chart.js
- X-axis: Date, Y-axis: Token count
- Multiple lines for different token types
- Responsive design with proper scaling

### 2. Daily Cost Breakdown (Bar Chart)
**Description**: Bar chart showing daily costs with stacked bars for different models or projects.

**Rationale**:
- Provides immediate visual feedback on spending patterns
- Helps identify which models/projects are most expensive
- Makes budget tracking more intuitive

**Implementation Details**:
- Stacked bars showing cost breakdown by model or project
- Hover tooltips showing detailed cost information

### 5. Token Efficiency Metrics (Scatter Plot)
**Description**: Scatter plot showing the relationship between input tokens and output tokens, with cost as bubble size.

**Rationale**:
- Helps identify efficient vs. inefficient usage patterns
- Useful for optimizing prompt engineering
- Provides insights into model performance characteristics

**Implementation Details**:
- X-axis: Input tokens, Y-axis: Output tokens
- Bubble size represents cost
- Color coding by model or project

### 6. Cumulative Cost Tracker (Area Chart)
**Description**: Running total of costs over the selected time period.

**Rationale**:
- Provides budget tracking capabilities
- Shows spending velocity and trends
- Helps with financial planning and cost control

**Implementation Details**:
- Smooth area chart with cumulative cost
- Milestone markers for budget thresholds
- Projection lines for future spending
