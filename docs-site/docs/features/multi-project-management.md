# Multi-Project Management

AiderDesk is designed to help you work on multiple projects at once without losing your flow. You can open several projects simultaneously, and each one will be displayed in its own tab at the top of the application window.

## Switching Between Projects

To switch between open projects, simply click on the tab corresponding to the project you want to work on. When you switch to a different project, AiderDesk will restore its complete workspace, including:

-   The full chat history.
-   The list of files currently in the context.
-   The last saved session.

This allows you to seamlessly move between different codebases, picking up exactly where you left off in each one.

## Project-Specific Context

Each project in AiderDesk maintains its own independent context. This means that the chat history, context files, and sessions for one project are kept separate from all other projects.

This separation ensures that you don't accidentally mix up information from different projects and allows you to maintain a focused and organized workflow for each codebase you are working on.

## Opening and Closing Projects

-   **Opening a New Project:** To open an additional project, you can click the `+` icon in the project tab bar. This will prompt you to select the directory of the new project you want to open.
-   **Closing a Project:** To close a project that you are finished working with, you can click the `x` icon on its tab. If you have any unsaved work in the current session, AiderDesk will prompt you to save it before closing the tab.
