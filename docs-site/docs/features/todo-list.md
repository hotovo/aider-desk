# To-Do List

AiderDesk includes a built-in to-do list feature that helps you keep track of the tasks required for your current work. This is particularly useful when working with the autonomous agent, as it allows the agent to create and manage a checklist of its planned actions.

## The To-Do Window

You can open the to-do list for the current project by going to **View > To-Do List**. This will open a separate window that displays the list of to-do items.

Each item in the to-do list has:

-   A checkbox to mark it as complete.
-   A description of the task.

## Agent Integration

The to-do list is fully integrated with the Agent Mode. The agent has access to a set of "To-Do Tools" that allow it to manage the list programmatically.

When you give the agent a complex task, it will often start by breaking it down into a series of smaller steps and adding each step to the to-do list. As it completes each step, it will automatically mark the corresponding item as complete.

This provides you with a real-time view of the agent's progress and helps you understand what it is working on at any given moment.

## Manual Management

In addition to the agent's automatic management of the to-do list, you can also interact with it manually:

-   **Adding Items:** You can add new items to the list yourself by typing in the input field at the bottom of the To-Do Window.
-   **Marking Items as Complete:** You can manually check or uncheck items in the list to reflect your own progress.
-   **Editing Items:** You can edit the description of an existing item by clicking on it.

The to-do list serves as a simple yet effective project management tool that is tightly integrated into the AiderDesk workflow, enhancing both manual and agent-driven development processes.
