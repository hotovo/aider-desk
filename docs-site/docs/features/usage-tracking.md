# Usage and Cost Tracking

AiderDesk provides a comprehensive dashboard to help you monitor your usage of AI models and keep track of the associated costs. This is particularly useful for managing your budget and understanding how you are using your AI resources.

To access the dashboard, go to **View > Usage Dashboard**.

## Usage Dashboard

The usage dashboard presents a variety of interactive charts and tables that give you insights into your activity. The data can be filtered by project and by date range, allowing you to focus on the specific information you need.

The dashboard includes the following components:

### Key Metrics

At the top of the dashboard, you will find a summary of key metrics for the selected time period, including:

-   **Total Cost:** The total estimated cost of your AI usage.
-   **Total Messages:** The total number of messages exchanged with the AI.
-   **Total Tokens:** The total number of tokens processed (both sent and received).

### Charts

The dashboard features several charts to help you visualize your usage patterns:

-   **Token Usage Trend Chart:** A line chart showing the number of tokens used over time. This helps you understand your usage trends on a daily basis.
-   **Daily Cost Breakdown Chart:** A bar chart that shows the daily cost, broken down by the different AI models you have used.
-   **Model Usage Distribution Chart:** A pie chart that shows the proportion of your usage for each AI model. This helps you see which models you are using most frequently.

### Usage Table

Below the charts, you will find a detailed table listing every AI interaction in the selected time period. Each row in the table corresponds to a single prompt and includes the following information:

-   **Date:** The date and time of the interaction.
-   **Project:** The project in which the interaction occurred.
-   **Model:** The AI model that was used.
-   **Tokens Sent:** The number of tokens sent to the model.
-   **Tokens Received:** The number of tokens received from the model.
-   **Cost:** The estimated cost of the interaction.

This detailed breakdown allows you to analyze your usage at a granular level and understand exactly where your costs are coming from. By leveraging the usage and cost tracking features, you can make informed decisions about your AI consumption and optimize your workflow for both efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
