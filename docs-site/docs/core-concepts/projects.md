# Projects

In AiderDesk, a "project" is a local Git repository that you are working on. All work is done within the context of a project.

## Opening a Project

To open a project, click the **Open Project** button in the top-left corner of the application. This will open a dialog where you can select the root directory of your Git repository.

Once you open a project, AiderDesk will:

-   Display the project's name in a tab at the top of the window.
-   Show the project's file tree in the "Context Files" panel on the left.
-   Load the project's settings, if any have been configured.

## Multi-Project Management

AiderDesk allows you to have multiple projects open at the same time. Each project is opened in its own tab, and you can switch between them by clicking on the corresponding tab.

This makes it easy to work on multiple codebases simultaneously without losing your context in each one. Each project maintains its own chat history, context files, and session data.

## Closing a Project

To close a project, you can click the "x" button on the project tab. This will close the project and remove it from the application. If you have unsaved changes in your session, you will be prompted to save them before closing.
