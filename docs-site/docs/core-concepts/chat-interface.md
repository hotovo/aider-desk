# Chat Interface

The chat interface is the primary way you interact with the AI in AiderDesk. It's designed to be intuitive and to provide you with all the information you need in a clear and organized way.

## Chat Modes

AiderDesk offers different chat modes to tailor the AI's interaction style to your needs. You can switch between modes using the selector at the top of the prompt input field.

-   **Code Mode:** This is the default mode for coding tasks. The AI will focus on generating and modifying code based on your instructions.
-   **Ask Mode:** In this mode, the AI is optimized for answering questions and providing explanations. It's useful when you need help understanding a piece of code or a concept.
-   **Architect Mode:** This mode is for high-level planning and system design. The AI will help you think through the architecture of your application and make design decisions.

## Message Types

The chat view displays several types of messages, each with a distinct format:

-   **User Messages:** Your prompts to the AI.
-   **AI Responses:** The AI's textual answers and explanations.
-   **Tool Messages:** When the AI uses a tool (like running a command or modifying a file), a tool message is displayed, showing the tool's name, arguments, and result.
-   **Log Messages:** Informational messages from AiderDesk, such as status updates or warnings.
-   **Diff Views:** When the AI modifies a file, a side-by-side diff is shown directly in the chat, allowing you to review the changes.

## Prompt Field

The prompt field at the bottom of the screen is where you type your messages. It includes several features to enhance your workflow:

-   **Command Suggestions:** As you type, AiderDesk will suggest available commands (e.g., `/add`, `/drop`, `/run`).
-   **Edit Format Selector:** You can choose the format for your prompt, which can influence how the AI interprets it.
-   **Input History:** You can access a history of your previous prompts by pressing the up and down arrow keys.
-   **Mode Selector:** As mentioned above, you can switch between different chat modes.
