# Sessions

A session in AiderDesk is a snapshot of your work that includes the chat history and the list of files in the context. Sessions allow you to save your progress and resume your work later, or to switch between different tasks within the same project.

## Saving a Session

You can save the current state of your work as a session at any time.

1.  Click the **Save Session** button in the top-right corner of the chat view.
2.  A dialog will appear, prompting you to enter a name for the session.
3.  Enter a descriptive name and click **Save**.

Your session, including all messages and context files, is now saved.

## Loading a Session

You can load a previously saved session to restore your workspace to the state it was in when you saved.

1.  Click the **Load Session** button in the top-right corner of the chat view.
2.  A popup will appear with a list of all your saved sessions for the current project.
3.  Select the session you want to load and click on it.

The chat history and context files from the selected session will be restored, allowing you to continue your work exactly where you left off.

## Managing Multiple Tasks

Sessions are particularly useful for managing multiple tasks within a single project. For example, you could have separate sessions for:

-   Working on a new feature.
-   Fixing a bug.
-   Experimenting with a refactoring.

This allows you to keep the context and conversation for each task separate, making it easy to switch between them without getting confused.
