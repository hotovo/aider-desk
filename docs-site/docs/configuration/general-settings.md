# General Settings

The General Settings section allows you to configure the overall look and feel of the AiderDesk application. You can access these settings by going to **Settings > General**.

## Theme

You can choose between three themes for the application's interface:

-   **System:** This is the default theme. It will automatically match the theme of your operating system (light or dark).
-   **Light:** This theme uses a light color scheme for all elements of the interface.
-   **Dark:** This theme uses a dark color scheme for all elements of the interface.

## Language

You can change the display language of the AiderDesk application. AiderDesk currently supports the following languages:

-   English
-   Chinese

After selecting a new language, you will need to restart the application for the changes to take effect.

## Automatic Updates

By default, AiderDesk automatically checks for updates on startup to ensure you are always using the latest version. If you need to disable this feature, you can do so in the General Settings.

Alternatively, you can disable automatic updates by setting the `AIDER_DESK_NO_AUTO_UPDATE` environment variable to `true`. See the [Environment Variables](./../advanced-topics/environment-variables.md) page for more details.

## Telemetry

AiderDesk collects anonymous usage data to help us understand how the application is used and to identify areas for improvement. You can opt out of telemetry collection at any time in the General Settings.

We take your privacy very seriously. The telemetry data we collect is completely anonymous and does not include any personal information or code from your projects.
