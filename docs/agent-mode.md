# Agent Mode in AiderDesk

Agent Mode is a powerful feature in AiderDesk that allows you to delegate complex tasks to an AI agent. This mode is designed to automate workflows, perform research, generate code, and much more, all within the context of your project.

## What is Agent Mode?

In Agent Mode, you provide a high-level goal or task to the AI agent. The agent then breaks down this task into smaller, manageable steps and executes them sequentially. It can interact with your codebase, use tools, and even ask for clarification if needed. This mode is ideal for tasks that require multiple steps, context awareness, and decision-making capabilities.

## Key Capabilities

-   **Task Decomposition:** The agent can break down complex requests into a series of smaller, executable steps.
-   **Tool Usage:** Agent Mode integrates with various tools, including Power Tools and Aider Tools, allowing the agent to perform actions like file operations, code search, and running shell commands.
-   **Context Awareness:** The agent maintains an understanding of the project context, including files, previous interactions, and goals.
-   **Interactive Communication:** You can interact with the agent during its run, providing feedback, answering questions, and guiding its progress.
-   **Autonomous Operation:** Once a task is initiated, the agent can operate autonomously, working through the steps until the goal is achieved or it encounters a situation requiring user input.

## How to Use Agent Mode

1.  **Switch to Agent Mode:** Select "Agent" from the chat mode selector in AiderDesk.
2.  **Define the Task:** In the prompt input field, clearly describe the task you want the agent to perform. Be as specific as possible to ensure the agent understands your requirements.
3.  **Initiate the Run:** Press Enter or click the send button to start the agent.
4.  **Monitor Progress:** Observe the agent's progress in the chat window. It will log its actions, thoughts, and any questions it has.
5.  **Interact as Needed:** If the agent asks for clarification or approval, provide the necessary input. You can also interrupt the agent or provide additional instructions during its run.
6.  **Review Results:** Once the agent completes the task, review the results to ensure they meet your expectations.

## Tips for Effective Use

-   **Clear Instructions:** Provide clear, concise, and unambiguous instructions to the agent.
-   **Start Small:** For complex tasks, consider breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks that you can delegate to the agent individually.
-   **Iterative Refinement:** If the agent's initial results are not perfect, provide feedback and ask for revisions. Agent Mode is designed for iterative workflows.
-   **Leverage Tools:** Understand the available tools (Power Tools, Aider Tools) and encourage the agent to use them when appropriate.
-   **Monitor Costs:** Be mindful of token usage, especially for long-running tasks or when using powerful models. Configure limits and monitor costs as needed.

Agent Mode transforms AiderDesk into a proactive assistant, capable of handling a wide range of development tasks. By understanding its capabilities and using it effectively, you can significantly boost your productivity and streamline your workflows.
