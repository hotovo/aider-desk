# Feature Specification: ZAI Coding Plan Provider

**Feature Branch**: `001-implement-zai-coding`  
**Created**: Fri Oct 03 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "implement ZAI coding plan provider among other providers, so user can easily configure it without the need of using OpenAI compatible provider"

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using AiderDesk, I want to configure ZAI as my coding plan provider so that I can use ZAI's specialized coding capabilities directly without having to configure it through a generic OpenAI-compatible interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am in the settings configuration area, **When** I look at available coding plan providers, **Then** I see "ZAI" as a distinct provider option alongside existing providers
2. **Given** I have selected ZAI as my provider, **When** I configure my ZAI credentials, **Then** I can save the configuration and use ZAI for coding tasks
3. **Given** I have ZAI configured, **When** I initiate a coding session, **Then** the system connects to ZAI using the native ZAI integration rather than an OpenAI-compatible wrapper
4. **Given** I switch from another provider to ZAI, **When** I save the changes, **Then** the system immediately starts using ZAI for new coding requests

### Edge Cases
- What happens when ZAI service is unavailable? The system should display appropriate error messaging and allow fallback to other configured providers
- How does system handle invalid ZAI credentials? The system should validate credentials and provide clear feedback on configuration errors
- What happens when user has multiple providers configured? The system should allow switching between providers and maintain separate configurations

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide ZAI as a distinct provider option in the provider selection interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to configure ZAI-specific settings (API keys, endpoints, model selection) [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific ZAI configuration fields are required?]
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate ZAI configuration before allowing the user to save settings
- **FR-004**: System MUST establish native connection to ZAI service when selected as active provider
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle ZAI-specific error responses and display user-friendly messages
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain ZAI configuration separately from other provider configurations
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to switch between ZAI and other providers without losing configuration data
- **FR-008**: System MUST support ZAI-specific features and capabilities that may not be available through OpenAI-compatible interface [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific ZAI features should be exposed?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ZAI Provider Configuration**: Stores ZAI-specific settings including API credentials, endpoint URLs, model preferences, and any ZAI-specific options
- **Provider Selection State**: Tracks which provider is currently active for coding operations
- **Provider Registry**: Maintains list of available providers including the new ZAI option
