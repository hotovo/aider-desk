## Verification Process

1.  **Lint and Type-Check Files:** After finalizing edits or writing new files, execute `eslint --fix` on all modified files to identify any errors.
2.  **Resolve Errors Iteratively:** Address all errors reported in the previous step. Repeat the "Lint and Type-Check Files" step and this "Resolve Errors Iteratively" step until no errors remain.
3.  **Handle Irresolvable Issues:** If you are unable to resolve an issue after multiple attempts and find yourself in a repetitive loop, stop the process immediately. Clearly state the unresolved issue and ask the user for guidance on the next steps.
